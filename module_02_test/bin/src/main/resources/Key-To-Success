There are no alternatives to working hard. Things may seem difficult when we start something 
new but we can reach our goal if we have that commitment to our goal and continue working hard
in the right directions. Where there is a chance of success there are more challenges to get 
that success, a person is tested all times highest for any success. A success without test 
is meaningless and not enjoyable. Brave people do not like to get something without challenge.
Be brave and embrace the challenges of the open world.
