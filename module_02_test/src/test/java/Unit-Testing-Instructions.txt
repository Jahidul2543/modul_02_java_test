Use TestNG as testing framework
All the unit test must have assertion in it.
A test is never a test without validation
You are free to do more unit testing of other packages not only mentioned two
Use testng.xml file in test resources(You have to create it by your own) to run
test classes together.
Your maven project should be capable of running from command line and you must
be aware of maven build lifecycle.
